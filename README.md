Bayesian and Markov-chain-based wind failure modeling for power transmission lines in Sicily using VAFFEL method.
# Thesis: Wind-Induced Failure Modelling in Sicily
This project implements the VAFFEL method with Bayesian updating and Markov-chain simulation 
to estimate fragility and failure probabilities of power transmission lines in Sicily.

## Main file:
`markov_chain1.py` — full pipeline including:
- Database reading and merging
- Bayesian updating of failure rates
- Fragility curve fitting (lognormal)
- Markov-chain simulation for single/double circuits[Uploading markov chain1.py…]()


Results are exported as CSVs and plots in the output directory.
